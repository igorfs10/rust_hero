# Art

Artwork was created using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org)

Early on it was decided to use vector based art for the creation of assets.  Vector art is highly reusable and easy to modify.  Vector art is converted into PNG format currently, though that is not needed, but done in the event we want to reuse characters and simply color their base differently and export them again as another character/creature.

The color palette used is the [Tango Icon Theme Color Palette](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Theme_Guidelines#Color_Palette)

# Music

Music was created using [LMMS](https://lmms.io)

Every song is a single riff that repeats endlessly.  Most songs were simply experiments to see if I could make a song that way.  For example the `Town` song is entirely made from ZynSubAddFX, while the `Swamp` song is made solely from the standard Triple Oscillator.  None of the songs are very complex.  I did no automation, used no effects other than what is on the presets.

I tried to use standard things everywhere, but use a very specific set of sounfonts for the `Forest` song.  The flute and cello are `Sonatina_Symphonic_Orchestra.sf2` which can be obtained via repositories, or located on the internet `//TODO`

The `Desert` song uses the built-in NESCaline , and the `Cave` song uses the built in Kicker for the drums and ZynSubAddFX for everything else.

**All songs are 120 Beats Per Minute**

This allows seamless switching between songs.
